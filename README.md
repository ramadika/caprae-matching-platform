# M&A Connect Platform

A modern B2B platform that revolutionizes business acquisitions by empowering sellers to initiate connections with qualified buyers, powered by AI-driven matching and streamlined deal workflows.

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript

**Why This Stack:**

- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development with instant hot reload
- **React**: Industry standard for complex interactive UIs
- **TypeScript**: Essential for financial applications requiring type safety
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes crucial for mobile-first executives

### State Management Strategy

3. **Verification** - Proof of funds, credentials

### 2. Matching Interface Design

**Bumble-Style Card Interface**:

- **Rationale**: Familiar, engaging interaction pattern
- **Mobile-optimized**: Touch-friendly for busy executives
- **Quick decisions**: Reduces cognitive load in screening process
- **Gamification**: Makes B2B process more engaging

**Essential Information Hierarchy**:

```
Primary: Name, Company, Budget/Valuation

Tertiary: Industries, Description, Details
```

### 3. Deal Management Dashboard
